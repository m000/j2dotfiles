# Function for grepping-out blocks of text.
# Usage:
#    cgrepv <skip_before> <skip_after> <expr> <file>
#
# Modern versions of grep support printing context around matches.
# E.g. to print 2 lines before and 3 lines after a match:
#	grep -B 2 -A 3 foo bar.txt
#
# However *not* printing 2 lines before and 3 lines after a match
# can't be done with grep. I.e., the following won't cut it:
#   grep -v -B 2 -A 3 foo bar.txt
#
# This function provides exactly this functionality. This is useful
# if you want to strip out markup blocks from a file. There may be
# markup-specific tools that allow you to do the same thing more
# reliably. But this function should work without any specialized
# tools installed.
